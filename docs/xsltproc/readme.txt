Windows
=======
To install on a Windows machine one needs to download the Windows binaries and
libraries.

These can be obtained from http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/ or
ftp://xmlsoft.org/win32/.

Download the following: 
  
 iconv-1.9.1.win32.zip 
 libxml2-2.6.15.win32.zip 
 libxmlsec-1.2.6.win32.zip 
 libxslt-1.1.12.win32.zip 
 zlib-1.2.1.win32.zip 

Unzip all and put the content in the location of your choice. Make sure that the
path to the EXE dans DLLs in each folder are on your path. One easy way to do
this is to copy all EXEs and DLLs in a single directory, and add that directory
to your path.
