<h1 align="center">mybastisnet documentation repository</h1>
<p>This document aims at describing the essential characteristics of the mybatisnet
documentation repository, and more specifically to guide documentation contributors
on how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>setup the tools required to build the documentation from source;</li>
  <li>perform the build, targeting various output formats (currently CHM and PDF).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Tools required</h1>
<p>The mybatisnet documentation source is in <b>docbook format</b>. More
  information on this format and associated tools can be found in
  <a href="docbook/README.html" target="_blank">docbook/README.html</a>.
  The complete set of tools required to build the documentation bundle is the
  following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>nant</b>, to run the documentation build script (see
    <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">
    http://nant.sourceforge.net/</a> to download and setup nant);</li>
  <li><b>docbook DTD and stylesheets</b> (see
    <a href="docbook/README.html" target="_blank">docbook/README.html</a> for
      instructions on obtaining and setting these up);</li>
  <li><b>xlstproc</b>, to convert the source documentation from docbook format
    to other formats (HTML, CHM, PDF,...) by applying XML stylesheets and then using
    other tools (see
    <a href="xsltproc/README.html" target="_blank">xsltproc/README.html</a> for
    instructions on obtaining and setting up the required xsltproc utilities);</li>
  <li><b>fop</b>, required to produce the PDF version of the documentation (see
    <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/download.html" target="_blank">http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/download.html</a>
    for instructions on obtaining and setting up fop).
    Note that FOP is implemented in Java, so you will need a properly set-up
    java runtime (JRE) to use it.</li>
  <li><b>HTML Help Workshop</b>, required to produce the CHM version of the
    documentation (see
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=00535334-c8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&displaylang=en" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=00535334-c8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&displaylang=en</a>
    for instructions on obtaining and setting up HTML Help Workshop).<br><br>
    <b><u>NOTE:</u></b> The workshop is actually bundled with other Microsoft
    products (not sure which, perhaps Windows itself). However, recent versions
    of the workshop (e.g., the one under Windows 7) don't seem to include
    <b>hhc.exe</b>, the command-line tool this project needs. It might therefore
    still be required that you install the workshop, even if you already have it.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Building the documentation under Windows</h1>

<p>Once the tools described above have been installed in the right places:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open a command prompt, cd to this directory, and make sure you have doc.build
    available;</li>
  <li>Run <tt><b>nant refDoc</b></tt> to produce CHM and PDF versions of
    DataMapperGuide and DataAccesGuide;</li>  
  <li>Run <tt><b>nant tutorialDoc</b></tt> to produce CHM and PDF versions of
    the tutorial.</li>  
</ol>

<p>The build script also contains other targets, please see doc.build for details.</p>

<p>Also note that as of this writing, the production of PDF output is not working and
  is actually commented ou in the build script. Also note that as a byproduct of
  the CHM output, the documentation is also generated in HTML format, which is
  prerequisite for the production of the CHM version.</p>
