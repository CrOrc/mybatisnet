<p>Docbook is a is an XML documentation format specification, essentially
  implemented in two things that a tool needs to parse a docbook source document
  (in XML):</p>
<ol>
  <li>an XML DTD (docbookx.dtd). This is available in many, many versions. From
    the headers in the mybatisnet source docbook documents, I deduced version
    4.1.2 is the one the source files are expecting.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Get the DTD and its dependencies at
        <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbkx412.zip" target="_blank">http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbkx412.zip</a>.</li>
      <li>Unzip the contents in docs/docbook/docbook-dtd. This location is 
      currently hardcoded in the mybatisnet docbook stylesheets, so it's
      important to unzip the files in the right place.</li>
     </ol></li>   
  <li>a set of XML stylesheets (xsl files), which are provided at
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook</a>.
      These instruction were tested with the latest stable release, which as of this
      writing is <b>docbook-xsl-ns&nbsp;v1.76.0</b>.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Download the stylesheets bundle at
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl-ns/1.76.0/docbook-xsl-ns-1.76.0.zip/download" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl-ns/1.76.0/docbook-xsl-ns-1.76.0.zip/download</a>.</li>
      <li>extract the contents of the top-level folder from the ZIP archive in
      docs/docbook. You should wind up with the following folders under docs/docbook:
      common, docsrc, eclipse, ... As for the DTD, these file locations are 
      currently hardcoded in the mybatisnet docbook stylesheets, so it's
      important to unzip the files in the right place.</li>
