<p>Docbook is a is an XML documentation format specification, essentially
  implemented in two things that a tool needs to parse a docbook source document
  (in XML):</p>
<ol>
  <li>an XML DTD (docbookx.dtd). This is available in many, many versions. From
    the headers in the mybatisnet source docbook documents, I deduced version
    4.1.2 is the one the source files are expecting. You will find the docbook
    DTD and its dependencies in the .\dtd folder. The original source for the DTD
    is <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/" target="_blank">http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/</a>.
  <li>a set of XML stylesheets (xsl files), which are provided at
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook</a>.
      These instruction were tested with the latest stable release, which as of this
      writing is <b>docbook-xsl-ns&nbsp;v1.76.0</b>.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Download the stylesheets bundle at
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl-ns/1.76.0/docbook-xsl-ns-1.76.0.zip/download" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl-ns/1.76.0/docbook-xsl-ns-1.76.0.zip/download</a>.</li>
      <li>extract the contents of the top-level folder from the ZIP archive in
      the .\styles folder. You should wind up with the following folders under docs/docbook/styles:
      common, docsrc, eclipse, ... As for the DTD, these file locations are 
      currently hardcoded in the mybatisnet docbook stylesheets, so it's
      important to unzip the files in the right place.</li>
