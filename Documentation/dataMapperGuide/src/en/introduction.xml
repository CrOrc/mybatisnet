    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>The iBATIS Data Mapper framework makes it easier to use a database
    with a Java or .NET application. iBATIS Data Mapper couples objects with
    stored procedures or SQL statements using a XML descriptor. Simplicity is
    the biggest advantage of the iBATIS Data Mapper over object relational
    mapping tools. To use iBATIS Data Mapper you rely on your own objects,
    XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you don't already know. With
    iBATIS Data Mapper you have the full power of both SQL and stored
    procedures at your fingertips.</para>

    <title>What's covered here</title>

    <para>This Guide covers the .NET implementations of iBATIS Data Mapper.
    The Java implementation offers the same services with some changes in the
    API.</para>

    <para>Since iBATIS relies on an XML descriptor to create the mappings,
    much of the material applies to both implementations.</para>

    <para>For installation instructions, see the section called the .NET
    Developer Guide.</para>

    <para>A Tutorial is also available. We recommend reviewing the Tutorial
    for your platform before reading this Guide.</para>
